  <p> About Us...</p>
  <div class= "us">
    <h4><b>The Magazine itself… </b> </h4>
    La Curiosité is an online magazine, run through WordPress by University of Bristol students. The magazine will feature articles in both English and French, so there’s plenty of opportunity to practice your language skills. We are hoping to publish articles on a bi-weekly basis as well as providing information about upcoming events within the French department and Instagram posts featuring photos from your Year Abroad and adventures around France in general.</br>
  <h4>  <b>What can I write about?</b></h4>
    Our magazine aims to encompass all things French, so there is a really broad range of topics you can write on. Whether you are interested in politics, current affairs, French culture, travel, cuisine, film, art etc. just suggest an article idea and we will get the ball rolling.
    For those on their Year Abroad we would LOVE to hear about what you are getting up to or any advice you might have for current second years considering their options.</br>
    We want to keep La Curiosité very much French focused so articles about Bristol student life in general isn’t quite what we are looking for.</br>
    <h4><b> Who can get involved? </b> </h4>
    Any MFL student can get involved, regardless of whether they are on their Year Abroad or don’t study French.</div>
